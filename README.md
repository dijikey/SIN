A simple framework you can use to make 2D games, based on Rust and focused on simplicity

__SIN is a very raw project, so it may contain bugs and lack some functionality.__
</div>

## Usage
Add `sin-2d` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`
```toml
sin-2d = "*"
```

__If__ you have any performance issues, __try__ optimization level 2.

```toml
[profile.dev]
opt-level = 2
```

## Overview
An example of using __SIN__ to create a window:

```rust
use crate::engine::{EngineBuilder, Game, State};

fn main() -> Result<()> {
  let engine = EngineBuilder::new("My Game")
          .game(MyGame{  })
          .size(800, 600)
          .build()?;
  
  /*
    Logic before starting the game.
  */

  engine.run();
}

struct MyGame {  }

impl Game for MyGame {
  fn update(&mut self, state: &mut State){
    /*
    Logic on update game.
    */
  }
  fn draw(&mut self, state: &mut State){
    /*
    Logic on draw game, 
        you can use `state.render` for draw a primitive figures.
    */
  }
}
```

## Implementation details:
* [`winit`] window handling library in pure Rust.
* [`pixels`] a tiny hardware-accelerated pixel frame buffer. ðŸ¦€.
* [`zxcmath`] for `Vector`, and other math types.
* [`anyhow`] flexible concrete Error type built on std::error::Error

[//]: # (* [`image`] for image loading and texture array building.)

## Feedback

This is my first serious Rust project, 
which I'm not good at anyway. 
So if it's possible to make the code cleaner and more user-friendly, 
then I'll be happy to accept help.

## Credits / Thank you
* [LÃ–VE], When creating the engine, I used the awesome LÃ–VE 2D framework as a basis.
